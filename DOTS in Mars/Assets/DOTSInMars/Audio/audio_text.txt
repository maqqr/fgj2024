"Oh, look at you trying to build a miner! It's like watching a baby take its first steps, except the baby is better at it."
"A for effort, D for execution. But don't worry, I'm sure there's a participation trophy for building the world's most underwhelming miner."
"Ah, constructing a miner, are we? I remember my first building. No, wait, it was actually good."
"I see you've chosen the 'hope and a prayer' method of construction. Bold strategy, let's see how that pans out for you."

"Oh, look at you, trying to build an ore refinery! I hope it's more stable than your last relationship. Remember, it's supposed to stand upright, not collapse at the first sign of stress."
"Wow, placing those structures like a pro... if the pro was a three-year-old playing with building blocks. Maybe try not to make it look like a modern art disaster this time, okay?"
"Ah, refining ore, are we? Hoping to turn that pile of space junk into something valuable? Good luck! It's like trying to make a gourmet meal out of expired canned beans."
"I see you're going for the 'chaotic mess' aesthetic with your refinery layout. Bold choice! I mean, who needs efficiency when you can have an industrial labyrinth instead?"
"Building again, huh? Remember, it's called 'ore refinery,' not 'bore refinery.' But looking at your design... I'm not so sure you got the memo."

"Oh, look at you, trying to build a manufacturer! Did you confuse the instructions with a recipe for a cake? Because what you're making sure looks half-baked!"
"Remember, it's not about how fast you build it. It's about whether it stays standing. But judging by your skills, I'd keep a helmet handy."
"Is that a manufacturer building or a modern art installation? It's hard to tell with the way you're setting it up."
"I see you're going for the 'structurally questionable' design aesthetic. Bold choice. Let's just hope it doesn't collapse faster than your enthusiasm."

"Look at you, being all efficient and stuff. Don't get too cocky though. Remember, even a broken clock is right twice a day."
"Any slower and we'll have to measure your progress with a calendar. Come on, chop-chop! We don't have all day - or do we? I mean, time is a construct, after all."
"Oh, take your time. It's not like we're on a different planet with limited resources and a harsh, lifeless environment or anything. No pressure."
"You know, they say insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. But hey, who am I to judge your unique strategy?"

"Wow, you actually shipped a product? I had a bet going that you'd accidentally ship a box of Martian rocks first. Guess I owe Jerry five bucks."
"Congratulations! You've successfully shipped something that might, just might, not get returned with a complaint note written in tears of disappointment."
"I see you've managed to ship a product without turning the factory into a fireworks show. I'm not sure if I should be proud or disappointed at the lack of explosions."
